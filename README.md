Rummikub Game Rules:

Objective:

    - Be the first player to place all their tiles on the table

Tiles:

    - 106 total tiles:
        - 104 colored number tiles, numbers range from 1-13, tiles come in 4 
          colors black, blue, yellow, and red
        - 2 Joker tiles
        - All tiles appear twice except jokers

    - Tiles must be placed on table in sets of "groups" or "runs"
        - "run": at least 3 tiles with consecutive numbers of the same color
            - runs cannot loop, aka 13,1,2 is not allowed
        - "group": at least 3 tiles with the same number, each of which with 
                   its own distinct color
    - Jokers may be used in place of any specific tile
        - Jokers that are acquired via a manipulation must be used in the same
          turn

Rules: 

    1. All tiles start face down on table, each player then chooses 14 tiles
       randomly. 

    2. Game begins with "Initial Meld", each player must place down sets 
       (groups or runs) which have numbers which add to at least 30. 
       - If a joker is used in the initial meld, its "number" is that of 
         the tile it is substituting
       - "Manipulations" are not allowed during the initial meld
    
    3. Once initial meld is achieved by a player, in subsequent turns that
       player may use tiles from their rack to create new sets on the table,
       use tiles from their deck to build upon existing sets on the table,
       or "manipulate"existing sets on the table so long as the manipulations
       includes at least a single tile from the players rack, and the
       manipulation does not cause any existing sets to become illegal. 

    4. If a player cannot, or does not wish to, place a tile on the table
       during a turn they are required to take a random tile from the tile pool

    5. If all tiles have been picked up from the random pile and a winner has
       not be decided, each player gets one more turn. The game will then end,
       the players will then add up the values of their remaining tiles on
       their rack and the player with the lowest value wins.
